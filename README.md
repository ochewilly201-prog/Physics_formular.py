# ➗ Physics Formula Calculator
A simple, command-line utility written in Python for performing common physics calculations across various introductory topics.
## About the Project
This project provides a basic interactive menu to quickly calculate key physical quantities such as **Speed**, **Force**, **Work Done**, **Pressure**, and **Density**. It is designed to be a lightweight tool for students and educators to verify homework or quickly solve problems using fundamental formulas.
### Formulas Included:
The calculator currently supports the following five formulas:
**Speed** $= \text{Distance} / \text{Time}$
**Force** $= \text{Mass} \times \text{Acceleration}$
**Work Done** $= \text{Force} \times \text{Distance}$
**Pressure** $= \text{Force} / \text{Area}$
**Density** $= \text{Mass} / \text{Volume}$
